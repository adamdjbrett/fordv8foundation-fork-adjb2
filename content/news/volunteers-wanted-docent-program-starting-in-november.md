There are many ways to be a volunteer at the museum! 

One way is to be a docent - a fancy word for "tour guide", some might say. If you enjoy meeting new people from around the country and the world, and have an interest in the classic Fords from 1932-1953, give this idea some time to brew. You do not need to be an expert on Henry Ford or the automobiles to be a docent. We will give you the tools you need to feel confident in sharing information and elevating the experience of our guests. 

Other ways to volunteer include utilizing skills and experiences you already have! Perhaps you are good at organizing, or creative with displays, or good at cleaning. Perhaps you enjoy setting up for events and are willing to assist taking down events. Perhaps you are great at making documents or flyers. We also need help addressing envelopes, stamping them, and getting them to the post office! Do you enjoy keeping up landscaping? There are always weeds to pull and trimming to do. Whatever you enjoy doing, there is likely a way to incorporate it into a volunteer position. 

There is no minimum time required. You volunteer when you want! It's a great way to meet new people and make new friends in a beautiful and calm environment. 

If you are interested in learning more, please plan to attend our Introduction Meeting/Coffee on Sunday Jan. 11 at noon in the museum library. You will meet Scott Campbell, one of our board members, and Jan Jones, our marketing and events manager.  

You do not have to RSVP, but if you know you would like to come, you can let Jan know at jan@fordv8foundation.org or call the office at 260-927-8022. 

We welcome you and hope to see you there!
