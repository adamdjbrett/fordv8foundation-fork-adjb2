Travel back in time to experience Christmas as it might have looked in the 1930's, 40's and 50's by having your photo taken in the period living room sets that have trees decorated as they would have been in those eras. There will be model trains to see on display and in action around a Christmas tree! 

The 1940's era living room will feature props from the movie "A Christmas Story" to have fun posing with! A life-size Ralphie in his pink bunny suit, the leg lamp, and the crate it came in will be ready for you! 

Stroll among the beautiful cars spanning the 1930's through 1953 while listening to live Christmas music played by the Dekalb County Orchestra, Auburn Community Band, and the Dekalb High School Choir. There is a fun 1927 cream model T that your family can climb into for a photo shoot! 

There are lots of things for the kiddos! Santa will be here, the Ford Elves are hiding all around the museum and one special elf, Frosty, is hiding, waiting for you to take a selfie with her! If you Check-In on Facebook and post your selfie with Frosty, you can be entered in a $25 gift card drawing for our gift shop! 

There is a craft area for kids of all ages to make ornaments, and a wishing tree to hang an ornament that they have written the thing they want most for Christmas on. 

There are fun gifts in the gift shop sure to please!
