We are hosting a catered dinner by Dutch Heritage of steak and chicken (pie for dessert!) with upbeat oldies music you love and a fun competition between tables of trivia "Kahoot" on the big screen! Then with lights dimmed enjoy dancing or listening to more fun oldies music from the 60's, 70's, and 80's! 

If you've never played Kahoot, you are in for a great time! Kahoot is a trivia game of easy fun topics like you see at Buffalo Wild Wings, or such, where you use your phone to click in your answers to multiple choice questions on the large screen. Competitions will be among tables, so only one person has to click in the answer.  You will be wanting to play this at your own next gathering! 

This event will be held in the BEAUTIFUL J. Windle Event Center on the Early Ford V-8 campus. Another reason to come out - check out this hidden gem event center for your next event! 

Show up at 6:00 ....Pick your table - tables seat 6 - dinner at 6:20... .Kahoot at 7:15ish...Dancing/singing along 8:15ish   Ends at 9:00  

No alcohol - but there will be pop, water, tea, punch, coffee 

Reserve your seats by Friday Jan. 30th by calling the office 260-927-8022,and paying $55 per couple or $28 for singles by credit card over the phone.
