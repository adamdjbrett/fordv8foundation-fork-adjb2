Put this event on your calendar because it will be the most interesting car show around! WE don't even know what may show up! There will be a wide variety of automobiles and even bikes likely, that all share one thing in common: they have a flathead engine! 

A full day of activities will be available - Mark Campbell, from the Henry Ford Heritage Association, will give a presentation, there will be oldies music, food, games, a trivia game on the big screen, a 50/50 drawing, and reduced museum admission. 

Registration forms for vehicles are available to download on the website flatheadsforeverreunion.com or you can call the office and register over the phone.
