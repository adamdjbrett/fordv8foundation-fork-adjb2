This Sunday, Nov 16th, at noon, come out and meet Craig Floyd, president of the foundation, whose dad, Joe Floyd donated all the automobiles in the replica 1936 car dealership Floyd Motors. This collection features every model Henry put out that year, including some extremely rare automobiles you won't see elsewhere! This includes the stainless-steel sedan Henry Ford gave to his top 6 salesmen, and the rare German Glasser, that escaped being confiscated by Hitler! And other rare vehicles! Craig has personal stories about each of them. 

This event is free with your admission and promises to be an interesting Sunday afternoon! 12:00-3:300
