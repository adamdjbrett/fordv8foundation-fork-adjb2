This will be a unique car show to add to your calendar! Even we do not know what kind of flatheads may show up! The event is free to the public, and a $25 registration fee for automobiles/bikes. Registration forms are on the website flatheadsforeverreunion.com or call the office at 260-927-8022 to register over the phone with credit card. We are accepting registrations now. 

There will be guest speakers from the Henry Ford Heritage Association, oldies music, food truck, trivia on the big screen, 50/50 drawing, museum tag sale, and games for a fun filled day! Tour the gorgeous Early Ford V-8 Museum while here for half price!  

This is the first annual event, and we hope for it to become a 2-day event next year!
